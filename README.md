counters
========
so counters are cool. all the cool cats use them to make today's view of the future exciting. stocks are so 20th century. get with the flow economy, baby.

for example, http://www.worldometers.info/ and http://www.census.gov/popclock/.

I thought it may be fun to to create a generic javascript counter that takes three arguments.

1. The title of the page
2. The growth per second of the phenomenon (gps)
3. The end of 2010 / start of 2011 estimate for that phenomenon

Examples
